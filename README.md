# Analyzing-and-hypothesizing-video-games
You work for the online store Ice, which sells video games all over the world. 
User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources. 
The objective is to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This will allow us to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns. 
In front of you is data going back to 2016. Let’s imagine that it’s December 2016 and you’re planning a campaign for 2017.

## Framework Steps
1. Cleaning and fixing the original data.
2. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.
3. Identify the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis.
4. Test hypotheses in Python.
5. Drawing a conclusion.

## Final Conclusion
In the process of analyzing the data, we cleaned it, prepared it, and checked it for correlations in order to make some recommendations for the campaign for the Ice video game company for 2017.
We performed statistical analyses for both samples using a two-tailed test to calculate the p-value and to compare it to the alpha value.
The statistical analysis reveals a difference between XBox and PC platforms as well as a difference in the sport ratings by users.
Based on the analysis conducted, we can recommend an action game for the PS2 aimed at a mature audience (rated M on ESRB).
